-OK, now sql querry works OK
-done: now i need to place all books into page books
-done: add user data on first user page (similar to books)
-done: search by writer. Question is why do i need to do it via php and on the page: found the way how to use it w/o separate php file but then a lot of php code in html page not good, back to php
    -done: first, execute with single book/writer
    -done: then think how to imprlement if there are more books for one writer. Idea: make new page writersearch result,
    done: plot the same as for all books then go to a single book choice
-done: search by partial name of the parameter (1 word of book name or only last name of writer)
-done: add messages about errors or success
-done: add books, delete books, edit books
-done: check why annotation cannot be properly placed (1 line, not at top-left): it can be but only if it is not
input field but tezt area=> changed for addbook. But for modifying boook annotation, i need input field since it has
to be pre-filled and this one can be used only by using jave scripti which i do not know yet, so far now forget
-done: now the question is how to orginize case scenario that delete and and edit is possible only from booksearch result and adding is possible when no bookid known
-done: create several navbars
-add checks for functions (try-catch)
-reserve and order
    -discuss behavior
